# Description
This is a collection of homeworks for "Calcolo Numerico" - 02023 course, Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, UniBo. 
These tasks are divided according to the topic in question seen during the course, in particular:
 - LAB_1 contains a little introduction to the `Python` language and to some of the mathematical methods and functions that are used in the following LABs, for this reason I suggest taking a look.
 - LAB_2 contains implementations and testing on direct (ex. Cholesky Fact.) and iterative methods (ex. Jacobi) to solve linear systems.
 - LAB_3 contains approximations methods and image compression (SVD and LSQ problem) made with them.
 - LAB_4 contains methods to solve non-linear equations.
 - LAB_5 contaisn image blurring and deblurring exercises other than Lambda penalty, Gaussian Kernel, Gaussian Blur and image noise.
